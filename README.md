# Informaci贸n de incendios en Castilla y Le贸n

This is a work in progress project that shows the public information of fires in the region of Castilla y Le贸n (Spain). It presents a table with its details, where you can use different filters that will be saved. At the same time, it presents a map showing their geographical location, which also responds to the filters.

The next steps are: adding some more tests, adding more interactive features to the map and showing both the table and the map on full screen (in different pages) when clicking on them. 

## Tech

This project is built with React. It also uses MaterialUI library for some components and React-Leaflet for the map.
The state is managed with ContextAPI. 
The filters are saved in the local storage.
It uses the public Castilla y Le贸n API:  https://analisis.datosabiertos.jcyl.es/api/explore/v2.1/console
